# How the code works:
# get_user_choice(): Prompts the user to enter their choice and ensures it is a valid input (either "rock", "paper", or "scissor").
# get_computer_choice(): Randomly selects a choice for the computer.
# determine_winner(): Compares the user's choice and the computer's choice to determine the winner based on the game rules.
# play_game(): Orchestrates the game by calling the other functions, displaying the choices, and printing the result.
# To run the game, simply execute the script, and it will guide you through the process of playing Rock, Paper, Scissors against the computer
