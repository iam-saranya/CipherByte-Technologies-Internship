#Explanation:
#Import the necessary modules: We import sounddevice for recording audio and scipy.io.wavfile for saving the audio as a WAV file.
#Set the duration and sample rate: The duration is set to 10 seconds, and the sample_rate is set to 44100 Hz, which is CD quality.
#Record the audio: We use sd.rec() to start recording. The parameters specify the number of frames (duration * sample_rate), the sample rate, the number of channels (2 for stereo), and the data type (int16).
#Wait for the recording to finish: sd.wait() ensures that the program waits until the recording is complete before proceeding.
#Save the audio: write() from scipy.io.wavfile saves the recorded audio to a file named recorded_audio.wav.
#This program will record audio for 10 seconds and save it to a file named recorded_audio.wav in the current directory. You can adjust the duration and sample_rate variables as needed.
