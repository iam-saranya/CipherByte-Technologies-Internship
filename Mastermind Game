#How the code works:
#get_feedback function:

#Compares the secret number with the guess and provides feedback on how many digits are correct and in the correct position (correct_position).
#Also provides how many digits are correct but in the wrong position (correct_digit).
#player_guess function:

#Takes the secret number as input and continues to prompt the player for guesses until the correct number is guessed.
#Provides feedback after each guess and counts the number of attempts.
#main function:

#Manages the flow of the game.
#Allows Player 1 to set a secret number and Player 2 to guess it, then swaps roles.
#Compares the number of attempts made by each player to determine the winner.
#Instructions:
#To run the game, copy the code into a Python script and execute it.
#Follow the prompts to set and guess the numbers.
#This implementation ensures fairness and proper feedback to each player's guesses, making for an engaging game.
